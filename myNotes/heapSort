  collection of data called a record

  record contains a key, which is the
   alue to be sorted.

   The remainder of the record consists of satellite data, which are
   usually carried around with the key.

  when a sorting algorithm permutes
   the keys, it must permute the satellite data as well.

  A sorting algorithm describes the method  by which we
  determine the sorted order, regardless of whether we are sorting individual numbers
  or large records containing many bytes of satellite data.

  Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine

  The term “heap” refer to “garbage-collected storage,” Our heap data structure is not garbage-collected storage,

  The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a
nearly complete binary tree 

Each
node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the
left up to a point

A.length, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and
A.heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within
array A.

0 <= A.heap-size  <=A.length
